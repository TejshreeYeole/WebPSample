WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossycompression for images on the web. Using WebP, webmasters and web developers can create smaller, richer images that make the web faster.
WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEG images at equivalent SSIM quality index.

The major component which causes the APK size to expand are the image files,
When we use unoptimized JPEG or PNG files,sometimes this files are much larger than we actually need them.Such files can be converted into a format called WebP. This format is created by google,retains the resolution & clarity of the image,but creates a much smaller file.

This sample demonstrates the use of WebP images over JPEG or PNG.
Follow the steps to convert the images to WebP and see the difference in the APK file size.

1.Right click on Image file -->Convert to WebP

2.Choose the encoding option,default its lossy with encoding quality set to 75%

3.You can slide it on the slider as per your requirement and see the difference in the WebP image.

4.Check the compression value and the image after conversion to WebP

5.This works amazingly !!!.

Happy Coding :)
